# Serverless CI/CD Security with AWS CodePipeline and Check Point CloudGuard Workload:
## Deploying and securing AWS Lambda functions with AWS CodePipeline and Check Point Serverless Security

**Check Point CloudGuard Workload** (ex Protego) is the serverless security solution from Check Point Software. It will provide build and runtime security for serverless applications as well serverless security compliance.

* The Build security or **Proact** performs SAST or static scanning analysis of the code and security posture management.
* The Runtime **FSP(function Self protection)** performs RAST or runtime security by whitelisting the expected behavior of the serverless application and by blacklisting the top 10 **OWASP** attacks > https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/

CloudGuard workload can be integrated with **ANY** CI/CD pipeline with plugins available either via SAM or CLI for example. SAM or Serverless Application Model is the AWS Open Source framework for creating serverless applications (https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).

In this tutorial, we will be using AWS CodePipeline to deploy a serverless application and add Cloudguard Workload as a step in the build and deploy phases of the CI/CD pipeline. We will show how to build a simple Lambda function using the AWS SAM CLI and then create a CICD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline to build, secure and deploy that Lambda function. 
We will integrate the Cloudguard Workload serverless security to AWS CodePipeline using the CLI plugin to perform Governance, Deep code analysis and Runtime application security. The proact feature perform the posture management check and SAST(Static Application Security Testing) while the Function Self Protection performs the runtime security or RAST(Runtime Application Security Testing).

It is important to note that there are other methods besides AWS SAM to build and package a lambda function such as the Serverless framework. please refer to my Tutorial using the Open Serverless Framework.

## Prerequesites:
On your laptop, please install the following:

> Install AWS CLI https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html

> Install SAM CLI https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html

> Install Git https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Please note that I will be using MacOS in this tutorial and feel free to use any OS of your choice.

The AWS CodePipeline create a CICD pipeline to build and deploy a Lambda function as described in the picture above. We will using the SAM cli  to generate the source code for the Lambda and needed templates that are needed in the build and deploy phases. 

## This tutorial will teach you step by step how to create a AWS Codepipeline with CloudGuard Workload Serverless security:
It is important to plan the creation of the resources needed in the CICD pipeline:
* Create a Repository on your laptop using Git and on AWS using AWS CodeCommit or GitHub. When a change or a commit is made it will be passed to an S3 bucket and then to Code Build
* A Build Project in AWS CodeBuild to checkout the code from AWS CodeCommit and package it. This includes the source code in a handler.js file, the SAM template yaml file and the Build specification yaml file or Buildspec.yaml. The Buildspec file defines flow of the various commands needed in each CICD stage in order to package and deploy the application using the SAM template. The CloudGuard serverless security will be integrated in CodeBuild with the Buildspec file using the CLI plugin.
* A CloudFormation Stack and Changeset to deploy the Lambda function in the Deploy phase. A cloudFormation stack will be needed to create a changeset and if you are not able to write a stack template, we will use the SAM deploy code to create one.
* IAM roles for all these AWS services will have to be created and needed permissions will have to be added for the CICD pipeline to execute successfully from build to deploy.
* The plugin for the Serveless security and CLI commands required by CloudGuard Workload in the Build and Runtime phases.

### Let's get started!

We will first use SAM to create a serverless project named here **cloudguard-app** for a simple node.js12.x serverless application. You can use your own source code and runtime with SAM if you prefer. This Tutorial applies to any serverless application that you chose to deploy. This will create a project directory that I named ./cloudguard-app but you can name the SAM project directory anything you want.

![header image](sam2.png) 

## The following ressources were generated as below:

**buildspec.yml** this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to define the build stage steps to package your application for deployment to AWS - - Lambda and add the cloudguard workload build and runtime security with proact and FSP(Function Self Protect)

**index.js** this file contains the sample Node.js 12.x code for the web service

**template.yml** A template that defines the application's AWS resources

**tests/** this directory contains unit tests for your application. This is optional but testing and feedback is a key component of     DevOps.

The Application is a simple node.js 12.x application that will return a string when invoked ..'Serverless Apps secured by CloudGuard Workload!

![header image](src.png) 

The SAM template or **template.yml** defines the serverless application: 

![header image](temp1.png) 

The build specification file or **Buildspec.yml** defines the required packages and uploads the deployment package to a Amazon S3 bucket.
You will have to create a AWS S3 bucket and add its name to the file and add the CloudGuard Workload CLI plugin to define Proact or the governance and static code scanning as well as the runtime application security testing with the Fuction Self Protection or FSP.
Lets first create the S3 bucket and do not forget to ADD to add IAM permission to CodeBuild role to access the S3 bucket or the build phases will fail with an error. You can use the aws command below:

> aws s3 mb s3://cloudguard-bucket

![header image](s33.png) 

Add the CloudGuard Workload security in the BUILD phase using the CLI plugin and configure the proact and the fsp. 

**IMPORTANT: You need to set your AWS Region as a variable as described by the export command. PLEASE CHANGE TO YOUR AWS REGION and REPLACE the ClouFormation stack arn of your serverless app or function in the cloudguard fsp -c command in the Builspec.yml!**

Please refer the annotations in the build and deploy stages or phases: 

**Note: A CloudGuard API token is required with the cloudguard commands to execute successfuly and you can add the token using the -t option or add a cloudguard-config.json file in your repository** 

![header image](build1.png) 

Its now time to intialize your project directory with Git, add all the needed files and commit them to your project.
For Repository, I am using AWS CodeCommit. If AWS Codecommit, you will first need to add AWS CodeCommit IAM permissions to your AWS account role in order to be able to push all the commited files to the AWS CodeCommit repository. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html
If you are using GitHub then you will need your SSH public key to your GitHub Repository.

![header image](git1.png) 

![header image](git3.png) 

# CodeCommit
I have created a repository in AWS CodeCommit and named it CLOUDGUARD-GIT. you can name yours whatever you want. You HAVE to initialize your repository by creating a file like README.md that describes the project that you are working on. Git will FAIL to push any files to your Repository if you do not initialize it! 

Once again.. you do NOT have to use AWS CodeCommit..you can use Github and select that as your repository when you create your AWS CodePipeline.

![header image](ccom.png) 

# CodePipeline

We are now ready to create the AWS CodePipeline at the CodePipeline service menu.
Enter a name for your pipeline. you can keep the rest of the settings as default as an IAM role for the codepipeline will be created

![header image](cpipe1.png) 

Then chose your repository and branch ..in our case the repository you created and the default branch master

![header image](cpipe3.png) 

![header image](cpipe4.png) 

# CodeBuild

For Build provider, choose AWS CodeBuild, and then choose Create project:

![header image](cpipe5.png) 

### Configure build project settings and choose Continue to CodePipeline.

* Project name – <your project name> in my case cloudguard-project

* Operating system – Ubuntu

* Runtime – Standard

* Runtime version – aws/codebuild/standard:3.0 ( The app is in node.js 12.x requiring ver3.0)

* Image version – Latest

* Buildspec name – buildspec.yml

**Please note the CodeBuild IAM role name as you will have to add permissions to allow access to all needed AWS ressources or the pipeline will FAIL..**

> codebuild-cloudguard-cicd-project-service-role

You need to select the <Run in priveledge mode> option for CloudGuard Workload to execute succefully.

![header image](cpipe6.png) 

# Deploy
We now move to the **Deploy stage** and we will use CloudFormation as the Deploy provider:

![header image](cpipe8.png) 

* **Deploy provider**: CloudFormation - we use that to deploy our serverless function using a CF Stack and ChangeSet.

* **Region**: your AWS region

* **Stack name** - the name of the cloudformation stack to deploy the lambda 

> You will have to first create a CloudFormation Stack which will be used by CodeDeploy to create a ChangeSet.
You can use the cloudFormation Stack Template is as below or you can write you own. Please refer to the AWS Docs for more details.

## Create Pipeline and Release Changes

You have trigerred the pipeline to run and you can monitor the pipeline execution under the CodeBuild Phase logs under Build Logs.
you can see that*
* During Proact, CloudGuard Workload did not find any malicious code after SAST scanning but flagged the Lambda role as too permissive. 
* The FSP runtime security was added succesfully to the Lambda function. A secure IAM permission will be suggested in the cloudguard log for the app or security team to take action. In this case, Proact was set to alert only mode but can be changed to fail the pipeline when malicious CVEs or permissibe roles are found.
  You have deployed and secured successfuly your serverless applications:
